Fitts' Law measures how accurately people can move from some point to a target using a pointing device. It's a mathematical equation. 



## Targeting
Targeting becomes way harder if you can't see the target, given it's a pointing-based targeting mechanism. 

Other mechanisms exist!

### Audio Targeting
Audio targeting would allow a person to select an item by making a predetermined noise. 

Better yet, make it 3D and include head movements. 

This would work particularly well with the audio cues in the audio notes. 

## Improving targeting

Easy way to increase the targeting effectiveness: make the targets bigger!

MacOS dock does this, though it negates the effect by also moving the target, making it harder.
